Description: Integration of Earth system data from various sources is a challenging task. Except for their qualitative heterogeneity, different data records exist for describing similar Earth system process at different spatio-temporal scales. Data inter-comparison and validation are usually performed at a single spatial or temporal scale, which could hamper the identification of potential discrepancies in other scales. 'csa' package offers a simple, yet efficient, graphical method for synthesizing and comparing observed and modelled data across a range of spatio-temporal scales. Instead of focusing at specific scales, such as annual means or original grid resolution, we examine how their statistical properties change across spatio-temporal continuum.
