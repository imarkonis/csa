## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Writen package names, software names and API names in single quotes in the Description text.

* Replaced \dontrun{} by \donttest{}.

* Used 'parallel' instead of 'doSNOW'.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
